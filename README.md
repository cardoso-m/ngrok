## Description

This guide provides a step-by-step process to set up and use Ngrok to expose your local development environment to the public. Ideal for PHP/Laravel developers, the tutorial covers everything from installing Ngrok to integrating with external APIs and testing callbacks and webhooks. By following this guide, you’ll be able to test your integrations in real-time and collaborate efficiently with team members, all without complications.

## Introduction

Developing and testing API integrations in a local environment can be challenging, especially when using tools like "php artisan serve" or XAMPP that don’t easily allow external access. To solve this problem, Ngrok is an incredible tool that allows you to expose your local environment to the internet in a simple and secure way.

This guide is for you, a PHP/Laravel developer, who wants to enhance your workflow and share your local environment with external APIs, clients, or team members without complications.

### Why Use Ngrok?

- **Ease**: Just one command to expose your local application to the world.
- **Security**: Secure connections via HTTPS.
- **Real-Time Testing**: Interact with external APIs as if in production.
- **Collaboration**: Share your environment with anyone, anywhere.

## Setting Up Ngrok in a PHP/Laravel Project

### Step 1: Installing Ngrok

1. Go to the official [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) website and download the version compatible with your operating system.
2. Extract the downloaded file and move the executable to a directory accessible via the command line.
3. Copy the directory of this folder. Example: `C:\Ngrok`
4. Add it as an environment variable:
   - Go to your Library
   - Right-click on “This PC” > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables
   - In system variables, click on `Path` and then on “Edit”
   - Click on “New” and paste the directory (Step 3).
   - Click “Ok” and the first step is complete.

### Step 2: Adding Your Ngrok Token

1. After completing the previous step, create an account on Ngrok and fill out the initial form.
2. Go to [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) to retrieve your token.
3. Go to the link above and click “Copy” under “Your Authtoken.”
4. Open your terminal and paste the following code: `ngrok config add-authtoken $your_copied_token` and press enter.
5. After this, a success message will appear; if there are errors, check the previous steps.

### Step 3: Starting the Local Server

- If you are using Laravel, you can start the local server with the command `php artisan serve`.
- If using XAMPP, make sure Apache is running.

### Step 4: Exposing the Server with Ngrok

1. In the terminal, navigate to the folder where you placed the Ngrok executable and run the command `ngrok http 8000`. If using XAMPP, replace `8000` with the port used by Apache, usually `80`.
2. Ngrok will create a public URL that you can use to access your application from anywhere.

### Step 5: Testing Integrations with External APIs

- Now, use the URL provided by Ngrok to set up callbacks, webhooks, or any external integration that needs to access your local server. The URL will look something like `http://your-url.ngrok.io`.
- If you have a local route `/login` without Ngrok, it will look like: `localhost:port/login`.
- The URL generated by Ngrok will be used as follows: `http://your-url.ngrok.io/login`.

## Tips and Tricks

- **Custom URLs**: Ngrok offers the option for custom URLs and subdomains (in the paid version), ideal for more serious projects.
- **Request Inspection**: Use Ngrok’s dashboard to inspect HTTP requests coming to your server.
- **Persistence**: Want to keep the public URL for a longer time? Use the authentication option for persistent sessions.

## Conclusion

Ngrok is an indispensable tool for any developer needing to test API integrations locally. I hope this guide helps you speed up your workflow and simplifies working with PHP/Laravel.
